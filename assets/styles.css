In your CSS code, you have set the `footer` to `position: relative` and `bottom: 0`, which means it will be positioned relative to its normal position at the bottom of the content. However, you have also set the `body` and `html` to `height: 100%`, which means the content will not fill up the entire height of the viewport.

To fix this issue, you can set the `min-height` of the `body` to `100vh` and remove the `height` properties from both `body` and `html`. Here's the updated CSS code:

```
body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

footer {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
  position: relative;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 60px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif, Arial, sans-serif;
}

nav ul {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

nav li {
  margin: 0 15px;
}

nav a {
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
  padding: 10px;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif, Arial, sans-serif;
}

nav a:hover {
  color: #f00;
  background-color: #555;
}
``` 

This should ensure that the footer is always at the bottom of the viewport, regardless of the height of the content.
